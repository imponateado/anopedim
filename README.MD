CLI made in Python to sort and delete WhatsApp exported chats. (actually I just made it thinking for exported whatsapp messages, maybe It's useful in another context)

Usage:
open main.py with whatever text editor you want, add what you want to be the delimiter in delimiter variable, modify the hardcodedwordstoremove and notremovestrings, open a cmd/terminal and type:
python main.py file.txt
